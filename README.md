# Echo-Server-on-Docker

With this Dockerfiles and Scripts you can run the Echo Server Instances in Docker Containers.

As the x86 Version is made by modifing the Dockerfile from the ARM Version of Unusual Norm, a special thanks to him!

In the near future I will add an Error Check and autorestart of the Server Instances when errors happen.
